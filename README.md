# SIEM & Honeypot | Microsoft Azure Sentinel Attack Map

### Summary
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management System. It is a solution that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats before they harm business operations. It is a tool that collects event log data from a range of sources within a network such as Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Identity solutions, etc. This allows the security professionals to monitor, prioritize and remediate potential threats in real-time. A honeypot is a security mechanism that creates a virtual trap in a controlled and safe environment to lure attackers. An intentionally compromised computer system to study how attackers work, examine different types of threats and improve security policies. This lab's purpose is to understand how to collect honeypot attack log data, query it in a SIEM and display it in a manner that is easy to understand such data. In this case it will be displayed in a world map by event count and geolocation.

### Learning Objectives:
- Configuration & Deployment of Azure resources such as virtual machines, Log Analytics Workspaces, and Azure Sentinel
- Hands-on experience and working knowledge of a SIEM Log Management Tool (Microsoft's Azure Sentinel)
- Understand Windows Security Event logs
- Utilization of KQL to query logs
- Display attack data on a dashboard with Workbooks (World Map)
